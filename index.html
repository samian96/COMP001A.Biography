        <p>My name is Samuel Iannazzo, I am 29 years old. 
            I have worked as a graphic designer for the past
            5 years. The past 10 years I have worked in the 
            custom textile printing industry. In my free time 
            I enjoy riding my motorcycle, as well as hanging
            out with my pet birds.

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3>Logo design for custom printing</h3>
        <p>Weekly I am working with customers to bring a more solid and
            polished look to their desired design for textile printing. This 
            includes using adobe illustrator to design the logo, as well as 
            separate the colors depending on the type of printing.
        </p>
        <h3>Suzuki Boulevard s40</h3>
        <p>In 2023 I had bought a 2007 Suzuki Boulevard s40 with a blown
            transmission. I spent the winter taking apart the transmission and trouble 
            shooting electrical on the bike. She took 3 months to get fully safe 
            for street riding and is my daily commuter now.
        </p>
        <h3>My Current PC Build</h3>
        <p>I am new to building PC so I did have help from my friend who has
            experience in this field. We decided on making a mini-itx build for 
            the purpose of saving space. It took us about 3 months in total 
            from sourcing parts, then a couple hours to build.
