        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3>Logo design for custom printing</h3>
        <p>Weekly I am working with customers to bring a more solid and
            polished look to their desired design for textile printing.
        </p>
        <h3>Suzuki Boulevard s40</h3>
        <p>In 2023 I had bought a 2007 Suzuki Boulevard s40 with a blown
            transmission. I spent the winter taking apart the transmission and trouble 
            shooting electrical on the bike. She took 3 months to get fully safe 
            for street riding and is my daily commuter now.
        </p>
        <h3>My Current PC Build</h3>
        <p>I am new to building PC so I did have help from my friend who has
            experience in this field. We decided on making a mini-itx build for 
            the purpose of saving space. It took us about 3 months in total 
            from sourcing parts, then a couple hours to build.
