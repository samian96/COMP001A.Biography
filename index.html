        <h3>Suzuki Boulevard s40</h3>
        <p>In 2023 I had bought a 2007 Suzuki Boulevard s40 with a blown
            transmission. I spent the winter taking apart the transmission and trouble 
            shooting electrical on the bike. She took 3 months to get fully safe 
            for street riding and is my daily commuter now.
